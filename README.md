#### üìÉ About Me/This Repo:
My name is Dean Rigney and I am from Co, Galway, Ireland and I studied Software and Games Development at Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest (formally known as Athlone Institute of Technology or AIT).

This repository is where I am going to post/showcase any personal projects I take up over the coming years. I love to learn/try out new things, so that will explain why the projects may be seem random, but know that they are or were useful to me at some point. There is method to the madness haha.

Currently teaching myself how to DJ as I have always had a passion for both music and technology. (There will likely be some coding project related to music soon).   

## üßë‚Äçüíª Current Coding Project...
 Finishing core functionality of a JDBC system (Java and MySql), that takes in the names and information of different authors, books and quotes. Im doing this project so that I can have somewhere I can store all of the key points/quotes from books that I read, so that I can look back whenever I want to try to further instil those nuggets of information into my brain.
