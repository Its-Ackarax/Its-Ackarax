A Bit About Me:
- My name is Dean and im from Co. Galway, Ireland.
  
- Currently I Am Trying To Build Up A Work Portfolio To Help Me Land My First Coding Job.
  - (Focusing On Things I Would Actually Use And Not Just Make A Note Making Application For The Sake Of It)
    
- I Love Constantly Having Something New To Look At To Try To Learn (Currently Teaching Myself How To DJ As My Two Biggest Passions In Life Was Always Technology And Music)
    - Because Of That I Will Likely Have Some Music Related Project On Here Sometime Soon.
