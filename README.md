## Ackarax - Dean Rigney
#### Software/Games Developer
My name is Dean Rigney and I am from Co, Galway, Ireland and I studied Software and Games Development at Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest (formally known as Athlone Institute of Technology or AIT).

This repository is where I am going to post/showcase any personal projects I take up over the coming years. I love to learn/try out new things, so that will explain why the projects may be seem random, but know that they are or were useful to me at some point. There is method to the madness haha.

Currently teaching myself how to DJ as I have always had a passion for both music and technology. (There will likely be some coding project related to music soon).   

Skills: Java, C, C++, C#, Unity

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating more projects to flesh out this repository
