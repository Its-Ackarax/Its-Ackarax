### üôã Software/Games Developer
#### üìÉ About Me/This Repo:
My name is Dean Rigney and I am from Co, Galway, Ireland and I studied Software and Games Development at Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest (formally known as Athlone Institute of Technology or AIT).

This repository is where I am going to post/showcase any personal projects I take up over the coming years. I love to learn/try out new things, so that will explain why the projects may be seem random, but know that they are or were useful to me at some point. There is method to the madness haha.

Also teaching myself how to DJ as I have always had love for both music and technology. (There will likely be some coding project related to music in the future).   

## üßë‚Äçüíª Current Coding Project...
Currently re-learning HTML and CSS in the process of trying to build myself a personal/portfolio website.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Future Coding Projects...
1) Learn Javascript to use React Native to build the front end for the 'Log Quotes from Books' app that I want to make.
2) Fix and polish the 'RogueLike' game I made in 'C' a few years ago.
